# CompuNAND

A C# simulation of a NAND computer inspired by nand2tetris

**What's this all about?**

The point of this project is to practice Object-Oriented Programming principles by building logic gates. NAND is considered to be the universal logic gate, meaning all other gates can be constructed using only NAND gates.

While that is true, I used NAND as a launchpad to build other gates, which in turn were used to build another, layer by layer.
